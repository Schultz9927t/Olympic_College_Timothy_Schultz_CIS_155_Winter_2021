                    There is so much you can do with music. Music is a very <br> 
                    beautiful form of expression. It tunes in to our emotions<br> 
                    and allows us to show how we feel. Paired with lyrics,<br> 
                    music is a story that you can tell. A canvas of sound.<br> 
                    The first step to getting there is first knowing how to<br>  
                    make music happen. This site will help you get there.<br>

                    I have been making music since I was around 12 years old. <br> 
                    My uncle inspired me to pursue this hobby that he has been <br> 
                    doing for years. My family is very musically oriented.<br> 
                    I would even go as far to say that music is in my blood.<br> 
                    Making music is an awesome way for me to be creative.<br>
