                There is so much you can do with music. Music is a very <br> 
                beautiful form of expression. It tunes in to our emotions<br> 
                and allows us to show how we feel. Paired with lyrics,<br> 
                music is a story that you can tell. A canvas of sound.<br> 
                The first step to getting there is first knowing how to<br>  
                make music happen. This site will help you get there.<br>
